      title: "What is the process of booking a charter flight? (applicable only to a full charter flight booking, not for booking individual seats on a charter plane)"
      desc: "You simply have to get in touch with us, and our representative will guide you through every step of the process. We will understand your requirement and help you select the best option from the wide range of aircrafts available.
